<p>In the upcoming lessons, we have created step-by-step instructions to help you complete this project.</p><p>Difficulty <strong>Normal</strong> : Use all Steps to complete the project.</p><p>Difficulty <strong>Hard</strong> : Use only Steps 1 and 2 to complete the project.</p><p>Difficulty <strong>Expert</strong> : Only use Step 1 to complete the project.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>START HERE</strong></p><p>For all difficulty levels, begin by downloading the <strong>turtle-crossing-start.zip</strong> from this lesson's resources and opening it in PyCharm. The starting project contains the starting code for the game, we'll walk through the code in the starting project in the next lesson. </p><p>Alternatively, you can create the entire project from scratch by creating a blank project inside PyCharm and create a Turtle screen that is 600px by 600px. You'll also need to turn off tracer(0) and use update() to refresh the screen every 0.1s. If you are confused about this, just use the starting project instead.</p><p>(If you can't use PyCharm, <a href="https://repl.it/@appbrewery/turtle-crossing-start" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here's a Repl.it link</a>)</p>
<p><strong>1. A turtle moves forwards when you press the "Up" key. It can only move forwards, not back, left or right.</strong></p><p><strong>2. Cars are randomly generated along the y-axis and will move from the right edge of the screen to the left edge.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-06-08_15-34-56-674db532b4f354631907d49c86afa8c5.gif"></figure><p><strong>3. When the turtle hits the top edge of the screen, it moves back to the original position and the player levels up. On the next level, the car speed increases.</strong></p><p><strong>4. When the turtle collides with a car, it's game over and everything stops.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-06-08_15-39-30-b9dd10632b6b9afde413d7451125a00a.gif"></figure>
<p>If you haven't already, download the starting project here and open it inside PyCharm. </p><p>The first step of creating any large project is to breakdown the problem into smaller, bite-sized chunks. Add the following comments to the starting code and try to tackle them one-by-one.</p><ul><li><p>Create a turtle player that starts at the bottom of the screen and listen for the "Up" keypress to move the turtle north. If you get stuck, check the video walkthrough in Step 3.</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-06-08_15-49-44-77946102102fce04b80c0283c72feb7d.gif"></figure><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Create cars that are 20px high by 40px wide that are randomly generated along the y-axis and move to the left edge of the screen. No cars should be generated in the top and bottom 50px of the screen (think of it as a safe zone for our little turtle). <em>Hint</em>: generate a new car only every 6th time the game loop runs. If you get stuck, check the video walkthrough in Step 4.</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-06-08_15-55-29-4d2450940d594e5273939e71bf752e0a.gif"></figure><ul><li><p>Detect when the turtle player collides with a car and stop the game if this happens. If you get stuck, check the video walkthrough in Step 5.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-06-08_15-58-16-b9a5a65868dad73a9894d74ce86802f6.gif"></figure></li><li><p>Detect when the turtle player has reached the top edge of the screen (i.e., reached the FINISH_LINE_Y). When this happens, return the turtle to the starting position and increase the speed of the cars. <em>Hint</em>:&nbsp;think about creating an attribute and using the MOVE_INCREMENT to increase the car speed. If you get stuck, check the video walkthrough in Step 6.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-06-08_16-01-00-bd5784414b8c2a7d383e97e2c1d07226.gif"></figure></li><li><p>Create a scoreboard that keeps track of which level the user is on. Every time the turtle player does a successful crossing, the level should increase. When the turtle hits a car, GAME&nbsp;OVER&nbsp;should be displayed in the centre. If you get stuck, check the video walkthrough in Step 7.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-06-08_16-03-33-71ce458b297a90d744f834f28b543854.gif"></figure></li></ul>
